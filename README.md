# Jumpro: Highly Functional Self-Destructing Robot
## Description
Jumpro is(/will be) a bipedal robot whose sole function is to Jump. Finished product will be powered by a Jetpack of sorts to jump even higher.
**There are no plans to implement any Landing Functionality.**

This is NOT practical. 

Prototype will be fabricated once the whole project works in simulations.

## Specs

* C++ only for control.
* Python for launch files and Gazebo simulations.
* ROS2 Foxy.
* Gazebo for simulations.
* URDF for modelling.

## Packages

* jumpro_description: Xacro files and some preliminary launch files for testing and simulation.
